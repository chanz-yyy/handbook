WORKSHOP FILE 2 — Memory
========================
Concept: ConversationBufferMemory

By default, every LLM call is stateless — it remembers nothing.
LangChain's memory system fixes this by storing conversation history
and injecting it into each new prompt automatically.

After completing this file you will understand:
  - Why LLMs have no memory by default
  - How ConversationBufferMemory stores chat history
  - How ConversationChain uses memory behind the scenes

# Why return_messages=True? It keeps history as a list of message
# objects (HumanMessage, AIMessage) rather than a plain string —
# which works better with chat-style LLMs.
