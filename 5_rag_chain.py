"""
WORKSHOP FILE 5 — Full RAG Chain (The Final Boss)
==================================================
Concept: RetrievalQA

This is where everything comes together. RetrievalQA is a LangChain
chain that:
  1. Takes a user question
  2. Runs it through the retriever (file 4) to fetch relevant chunks
  3. Injects those chunks into a prompt as context
  4. Sends the prompt to the LLM
  5. Returns a grounded answer based only on the document

This is the answer to the hallucination demo — the same question that
the LLM got wrong at the start of the session will now be answered
correctly from the actual handbook.

After completing this file you will understand:
  - How RetrievalQA chains a retriever and LLM together
  - What "grounded" answers mean and why they matter
  - How the full RAG pipeline flows end to end

    # YOUR CODE HERE
    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # Create a RetrievalQA chain that connects the retriever and LLM.
    #
    # RetrievalQA.from_chain_type() takes:
    #   llm        → the language model that generates the answer
    #   retriever  → fetches the relevant chunks for each question
    #   return_source_documents=True → also return which chunks were used
    #                                  (useful for debugging and trust)

    # Hint:
    # qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type()
