WORKSHOP FILE 3 — Document Loading and Splitting
=================================================
Concept: PyPDFLoader + RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

An LLM can't read an entire PDF in one shot — the context window
is limited. LangChain solves this by loading the PDF and splitting
it into small overlapping chunks that can each be embedded and searched.

After completing this file you will understand:
  - How LangChain loads PDFs as a list of Document objects
  - Why we split documents into chunks before embedding
  - What chunk_size and chunk_overlap mean and why they matter

    # YOUR CODE HERE — Part 1: Load the PDF
    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # Use PyPDFLoader to load the PDF file.
    # Call .load() on it to get a list of Document objects
    # (one Document per page).

    # loader = PyPDFLoader(?)

    # YOUR CODE HERE — Part 2: Split into chunks
    # ------------------------------------------------------------
    # Create a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter and split the docs.

    # chunk_size=500    → each chunk is at most 500 characters
    # chunk_overlap=50  → consecutive chunks share 50 characters

    #                      that span a chunk boundary)
